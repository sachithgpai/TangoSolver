# TangoSolver.
Trying to get machine to solve the Tango game I play on LinkedIn everyday.


## Step 1 - A dataset.
Create a simple interface with Tkinter.



## Step 2 - LP solver
Create the constraints to use a LP solver (PuLP) to find the solution. 



## TO DO:
- [x] Create Inequality buttons. Normal buttons look ugly. Maybe reuse the ImageButton format.
- [x] Add the inquality constrains to LP solver.
- [ ] Create a collection of Tango Games.
- [ ] Test the difference in different optimizer functions.
